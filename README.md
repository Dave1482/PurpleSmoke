# PurpleSmoke
A work-in-progress repository for breaking the security of iOS 11.2 up to 11.3

This is intentionally written for my own personal practice but it can be useful to others interested in breaking iOS security as well.

Whenever you think something should be changed just make a pull request.

This repository also contains the work of security researchers which I thank for opensourcing.
This project contains my own modified version of liblorgnette, credits should go to the original creators of liblorgnette.
